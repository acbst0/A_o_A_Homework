Interpolation Search is a search algorithm that speeds up finding data. The array must be ordered. It makes a linear prediction between elements. The prediction determines the possible location of the target. It allows it to search more efficiently. It is especially effective with large datasets. The search time is not logarithmic, but it is still fast. Narrows the search range, so it is more efficient than other search algorithms.
