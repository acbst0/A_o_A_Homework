Insertion Sort is one of the sorting algorithms. It divides the list into ordered and unordered sections. At each step, it inserts one element of the unordered partition into the sorted partition and places it in the appropriate position. This process continues until all elements are added to the sorted partition. While Insertion Sort is effective for small list sizes, its performance may be poor for large lists.
