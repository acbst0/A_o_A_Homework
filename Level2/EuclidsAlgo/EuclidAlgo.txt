Euclid's Algorithm is an algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. This algorithm was developed by the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid and has been used for thousands of years. Its basic principle is based on division between two numbers. First, two numbers are taken, aa and bb. Then, the process continues by dividing aa and bb by each other until bb is equal to zero. At each step, aa is divided by bb and the remainder is taken. bb is now assigned to aa and the remainder is assigned to bb. This process is repeated until bb equals zero. When bb is zero, aa will be the greatest common divisor (GCD). The Euclidean Algorithm is extremely efficient and the time complexity is calculated as O(log(min(a,b)))O(log(min(a,b))), making it an ideal option for finding the GCD between large numbers.
