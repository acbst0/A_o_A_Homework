I started coding this project early, but due to some projects, some of them were left to the test day. As someone who normally uses C++ and C, I used Python in this project, although I am not very used to it. The main reason why I prefer Python is that unlike C++, Python provides much more convenience in adding and subtracting arrays. Apart from that, problems such as memory allocation in C language do not exist in Python language. In short, I preferred Python because it is the easiest and fastest coding language.

The tools I use and why I use them are as follows;
Chat-GPT : Which are the simplest among the given algorithms (for easy coding :)). And to correct grammatical errors in the description texts.
StackOverflow and YouTube : I used it to learn the algorithms I chose.
DeepL :  I used it to fix my mistakes during my translations
